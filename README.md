Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction
In the first task, I explored the classic Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival. Leveraging machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques, I aimed to uncover patterns and factors influencing survival rates. My approach and code for this task can be found on GitHub.

I'm excited to share that I've successfully completed my first task during my Data Science internship at CodSoft! ðŸŽ‰ This task involved building a predictive model to determine whether a passenger on the Titanic survived, utilizing the Titanic dataset.

The aim was to create a model that predicts survival based on passenger information such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and survival status.
I carefully prepared the dataset by handling missing values, ensuring dataset for analysis. Using Python and libraries such as Pandas, I developed a
machine learning model to predict survival. Implemented Logistic Regression to capture the relationship between passenger characteristics and survival outcomes.

This task significantly honed my skills in using Logistic Regression for binary classification problems. The model successfully predicted survival with notable accuracy and provided deep insights into how demographic factors impacted survival chances on the Titanic.

I'm eager to leverage these insights and my growing skill set in future projects!!ðŸ‘œ ðŸ’¡ 



Task 2:SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON
I'm excited to share the successful completion of my task during my Data Science internship at CodSoft! ðŸŽ‰ This project involved building a predictive model to forecast future sales using the Advertising dataset.


The objective was to predict sales based on advertising expenditures across TV, radio, and newspapers. I began by loading and preparing the dataset, which included renaming columns for clarity, handling missing values, and conducting exploratory analysis with pairplots and a correlation heatmap to understand the relationships between variables.


Using Python and libraries like Scikit-learn, Statsmodels , and Pandas, I developed an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Linear Regression model. I split the data into training and testing sets and trained the model on the historical advertising data. The model was evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared metrics, demonstrating its accuracy in predicting sales. The analysis revealed significant positive impacts of TV and radio advertising on sales, while newspaper advertising had a lesser effect.


This task sharpened my skills in linear regression and sales forecasting, offering valuable insights into advertising effectiveness. I look forward to applying these skills to future projects! ðŸ“ŠðŸ’¡


Task 3:CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION
The final task revolved around Credit Card Fraud Detection, a critical application of machine learning in finance. I implemented models to identify fraudulent transactions, contributing to the ongoing efforts to enhance financial security. The code and insights are available on GitHub.
I'm pleased to announce the successful completion of my Final task during my Data Science internship at CodSoft! ðŸŽ‰ This project involved creating a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset.


I began by exploring the dataset to understand its structure and handling class imbalance, where fraudulent transactions were much fewer than genuine ones. After normalizing the Amount and Time features with StandardScaler, I split the data into training and testing sets.


Using Python and libraries such as Scikit-learn and Pandas, I trained a Logistic Regression model, adjusting for class imbalance with the class_weight='balanced' parameter. The model was evaluated using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score, and visualized with a confusion matrix heatmap.


This project honed my skills in handling imbalanced data and using classification metrics for model evaluation. The insights gained underscore the importance of preprocessing and model tuning in fraud detection.
I look forward to applying these insights in future projects!ðŸ“ŠðŸ’¡
