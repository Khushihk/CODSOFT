Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction
In the first task, I explored the classic Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival. Leveraging machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques, I aimed to uncover patterns and factors influencing survival rates. My approach and code for this task can be found on GitHub.

I'm excited to share that I've successfully completed my first task during my Data Science internship at CodSoft! ðŸŽ‰ This task involved building a predictive model to determine whether a passenger on the Titanic survived, utilizing the Titanic dataset.

The aim was to create a model that predicts survival based on passenger information such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and survival status.
I carefully prepared the dataset by handling missing values, ensuring dataset for analysis. Using Python and libraries such as Pandas, I developed a
machine learning model to predict survival. Implemented Logistic Regression to capture the relationship between passenger characteristics and survival outcomes.

This task significantly honed my skills in using Logistic Regression for binary classification problems. The model successfully predicted survival with notable accuracy and provided deep insights into how demographic factors impacted survival chances on the Titanic.

I'm eager to leverage these insights and my growing skill set in future projects!!ðŸ‘œ ðŸ’¡
